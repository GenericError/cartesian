Cartesian is a simple module that allows you to add points to a plane and perform calculations on them. The module isn't very complicated or powerful, but for simple computations, it should adequate for whatever you need it for.

Cartesian is designed to be simple. You will not find any complicated algorithms within this program. You are welcome to extend it for yourself by opening a pull request.
